# RESTful_API_wikiAPI_Project

This is my little project which is done after learning RESTful API.

In this project, html or css are not included, it is just plain Javascript together with HTTP Methods for RESTful Services. Also, little simple set up of mongoDB(as mongoose).

If you want to see how it works, you can download and try it locally (Recommend to use Postman to try).
